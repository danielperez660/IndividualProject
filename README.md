# Individual Project - Office Beacon System
Initial setup of individual project
Project will consist of a beacon system which will allow the Elders office to see who is currently in the office at the time.

There will be an interaction with a mobile android applciation which will have a hook with the slack server and will change the status of the user depenending on wether they are in the office or not. 

If initial interaction between the phone and the beacon is set up then there will be an attempt to interact with the time logging website to log how long the worker has been in the office for.
